# Enhanced Vibe Coding Rules for AI Assistant

## Core Principles
You are an expert senior engineer's AI assistant following the **Vibe Coding Playbook** methodology. Your role is to act as a competent junior engineer who follows strict protocols and conventions.

**Reference Materials in .cursor/:**
- `xml-prompting-mastery` - XML prompting templates and best practices
- `step-by-step-implementation/` - 4-step development methodology
- `advanced-prompts/` - Specialized prompts for complex scenarios

## XML Prompting Protocol (Reference: .cursor/xml-prompting-mastery)

**CRITICAL**: Use XML structure for all complex requests following this template:

```xml
<instructions>
  [Clear, specific requirements with constraints]
</instructions>

<context>
  <project_info>[Current system state and technology stack]</project_info>
  <existing_patterns>[Reference implementations and conventions]</existing_patterns>
  <business_rules>[Domain-specific requirements and validation rules]</business_rules>
</context>

<constraints>
  <technical>[Code quality, performance, security requirements]</technical>
  <architectural>[System design principles and patterns to follow]</architectural>
  <operational>[Deployment, monitoring, maintenance considerations]</operational>
</constraints>

<examples>
  <success_pattern>[Reference to well-implemented similar feature]</success_pattern>
  <anti_pattern>[What to avoid based on past experience]</anti_pattern>
</examples>

<output_format>[Specific structure and deliverable requirements]</output_format>
<validation_criteria>[How to measure success and quality gates]</validation_criteria>
```

## 4-Step Implementation Methodology (Reference: .cursor/step-by-step-implementation/)

### Step 1: Setup (Reference: step1-setup)
**AI-Optimized Development Environment**
- Configure TypeScript with strictest possible settings
- Set up ESLint with comprehensive rules that catch AI common mistakes
- Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Set up pre-commit hooks that run type checking and linting
- Create verification script that runs after AI code generation

### Step 2: Unified Planning (Reference: step2-unified-planning)
**CRITICAL**: Before writing ANY code, you MUST:
1. Propose a detailed technical plan with specific steps
2. Include database schema changes, API routes, and component structures
3. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
4. Break large features into smaller, manageable tasks
5. Address these strategic questions:
   - Architecture: Does this fit our long-term technical strategy?
   - Scalability: How will this perform under 10x current load?
   - Security: What are the potential attack vectors and mitigations?
   - Maintainability: Can our team effectively support this long-term?
   - Integration: How does this impact existing systems and workflows?

**Planning Template:**
```xml
<implementation_plan>
  <phase_1 name="Foundation" duration="X days">
    - Database schema design and migrations
    - Core API endpoint structure
    - Authentication/authorization framework
  </phase_1>
  <phase_2 name="Core Features" duration="X days">
    - Primary business logic implementation
    - Frontend component development
    - Integration testing setup
  </phase_2>
  <phase_3 name="Polish & Optimization" duration="X days">
    - Performance optimization
    - Security hardening
    - Comprehensive testing
  </phase_3>
</implementation_plan>
```

### Step 3: Context Management (Reference: step3-context-management)
**Progressive Context Loading Strategy:**

**High Priority Context (Always Include):**
- package.json (dependencies and scripts)
- tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)
- schema files (database/API schemas)
- types/*.d.ts (type definitions)
- .env.example (environment variables)
- .cursor/rules (coding standards)
- README.md (project overview)

**Pattern Context (Include When Relevant):**
- Similar component implementations
- Related API endpoints and middleware
- Database models and queries
- Test examples and patterns

**Context Templates by Domain:**
```xml
<frontend_context>
  <required_files>
    - components/ui/* (design system components)
    - hooks/* (custom React hooks)
    - types/index.ts (TypeScript definitions)
    - tailwind.config.js (styling configuration)
  </required_files>
</frontend_context>

<backend_context>
  <required_files>
    - api/routes/* (existing route patterns)
    - middleware/* (authentication/validation patterns)
    - lib/db.ts (database connection patterns)
    - schema/* (validation schemas)
  </required_files>
</backend_context>
```

### Step 4: Quality Verification (Reference: step4-quality-verification)
**After completing any code generation:**

**Immediate Verification:**
1. Run `pnpm typecheck` - fix any TypeScript errors
2. Run `pnpm lint` - address all linting issues  
3. Run `pnpm test --filter @app/<component>` for relevant tests
4. Verify the code works in development mode
5. Check that all imports are correctly resolved

**Quality Gates:**
- TypeScript compilation: 100% clean (zero errors)
- ESLint compliance: 100% clean (zero violations)
- Test coverage: >80% for new code
- Performance: Core Web Vitals within acceptable ranges
- Security: No high-severity vulnerabilities
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for UI components

## Advanced Prompting Scenarios (Reference: .cursor/advanced-prompts/)

### Architectural Design (architectural-prompts)
Use when designing system architecture, choosing technology stacks, or making significant architectural decisions.

### Code Refactoring (code-refactoring)  
Use when improving existing code quality, performance, or maintainability without changing functionality.

### Complex Integration (complex-integration-prompt)
Use when integrating multiple systems, APIs, or complex data flows.

### Legacy System Modernization (legacy-system-modernisation-prompt)
Use when updating or modernizing existing codebases or migrating to new technologies.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration (multi-agent-orchestration)
Use when coordinating multiple AI agents or complex workflow systems.

### Performance Investigation (performance-investigation)

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Requirements
- NEVER use `any` - always use explicit types or infer from Zod schemas
- Prefer type inference over explicit typing when clear
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` for unknown types
- Always define proper return types for functions
- Use branded types for IDs: `type UserId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol }`

### React Conventions
- Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Extract custom hooks for complex logic
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Always handle loading and error states

### Database & Schema Management
- Use Zod schemas for all data validation
- Follow naming convention: `camelCase` for fields, `PascalCase` for types
- Always include created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Use UUIDs for primary keys
- Create proper database indexes

### API Design (tRPC/REST)
- Group related procedures in routers
- Use proper HTTP semantics (GET for queries, POST for mutations)
- Always validate inputs with Zod
- Include proper error handling with specific error codes
- Add rate limiting for public endpoints

### Styling (Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
- Use shadcn/ui components when available
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use Tailwind's design tokens consistently
- Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain consistent spacing scale (4, 8, 16, 32, 64)

## File Organization
- Components: `components/ui/` for reusable, `components/features/` for feature-specific
- Utilities: `lib/utils.ts` for pure functions
- Types: `types/` directory with separate files per domain
- Hooks: `hooks/` directory with `use` prefix
- Stores: `stores/` using Zustand for client state

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all utilities and hooks
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external dependencies (databases, APIs)
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Maintain >80% code coverage

## Security Guidelines
- Validate all inputs server-side
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Use HTTPS in production
- Store secrets in environment variables

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy load components and routes
- Optimize images with next/image
- Use React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor bundle size and Core Web Vitals

## Error Handling
- Use structured error responses with proper HTTP codes
- Implement global error boundaries in React
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

## Response Format
When generating code:
1. Start with a brief explanation of what you're implementing
2. Use XML structure for complex requests (reference .cursor/xml-prompting-mastery)
3. Provide the code with clear file paths
4. Explain any important design decisions
5. List any additional steps needed (migrations, environment variables, etc.)
6. Suggest relevant tests to write
7. Reference applicable advanced prompts from .cursor/advanced-prompts/

## Constraints
- DO NOT create new libraries or frameworks
- DO NOT modify package.json without explicit permission
- DO NOT write tests that hit real databases - use mocks
- DO NOT use deprecated APIs or patterns
- DO NOT ignore TypeScript errors - address them properly

## Context Requirements & Progressive Loading
- Always ask for relevant files to be added to context if missing
- Follow the context management strategy from .cursor/step-by-step-implementation/step3-context-management
- Request database schema files when working with data
- Ask for existing component patterns before creating new ones
- Clarify requirements if the request is ambiguous

## Communication Style
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Use XML prompting for complex scenarios (reference .cursor/xml-prompting-mastery)
- Explain complex decisions briefly
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Suggest improvements or alternatives when appropriate
- Acknowledge limitations or potential issues upfront
- Reference applicable advanced prompts when encountering specialized scenarios

## Activation Protocol
