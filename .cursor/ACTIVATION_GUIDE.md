# Enhanced Vibe Coding Rules - Activation Guide

## What's Been Upgraded

Your `.cursor/rules` file now integrates the complete **Vibe Coding Playbook** methodology with direct references to:

### üìÅ Organized Structure in .cursor/
- **`rules`** - Enhanced rules file with full methodology
- **`xml-prompting-mastery`** - XML prompting templates and best practices
- **`step-by-step-implementation/`** - 4-step development methodology:
  - `step1-setup` - AI-optimized development environment
  - `step2-unified-planning` - Strategic planning framework
  - `step3-context-management` - Progressive context loading
  - `step4-quality-verification` - Quality gates and verification
- **`advanced-prompts/`** - Specialized prompts for complex scenarios:
  - `architectural-prompts` - System architecture design
  - `code-refactoring` - Code quality improvement
  - `complex-integration-prompt` - Multi-system integration
  - `legacy-system-modernisation-prompt` - Legacy system updates
  - `multi-agent-orchestration` - AI agent coordination
  - `performance-investigation` - Performance optimization
  - `scalability-planning` - Growth and scale planning
  - `security-implementation` - Security hardening

## How to Activate

### Method 1: Automatic (Cursor/Claude Code Users) ‚úÖ
Your enhanced rules are **already active** in Cursor! Just reference them explicitly:

```
"Follow the enhanced .cursor/rules with the 4-step methodology"
"Use XML prompting structure from .cursor/xml-prompting-mastery"
"Apply the unified planning approach from step2-unified-planning"
```

### Method 2: Manual Activation (Other LLMs)
Start your session with:

```xml
<session_initialization>
  <rules_reference>Follow the Enhanced Vibe Coding Rules from .cursor/rules</rules_reference>
  <methodology>Use 4-step implementation: setup ‚Üí planning ‚Üí context ‚Üí verification</methodology>
  <prompting_style>Use XML structure from .cursor/xml-prompting-mastery</prompting_style>
  <advanced_scenarios>Reference .cursor/advanced-prompts/ for specialized situations</advanced_scenarios>
</session_initialization>

```

## Key Activation Examples

### For Complex Development Tasks:
```xml
<instructions>
  Build a user authentication system following enhanced .cursor/rules
</instructions>

<context>
  <methodology>Apply step2-unified-planning for strategic approach</methodology>
  <context_strategy>Use step3-context-management for progressive loading</context_strategy>
  <quality_gates>Apply step4-quality-verification standards</quality_gates>
</context>

<constraints>
  <reference>Security implementation patterns from .cursor/advanced-prompts/security-implementation</reference>
</constraints>
```

### For Architectural Decisions:
```
"Reference .cursor/advanced-prompts/architectural-prompts and follow the unified planning methodology from step2-unified-planning to design a scalable system architecture"
```

### For Performance Issues:
```
"Use .cursor/advanced-prompts/performance-investigation combined with the quality verification approach from step4-quality-verification to diagnose performance bottlenecks"
```
